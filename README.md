# AutoSpotting

Automatically convert your existing Auto Scaling groups to significantly cheaper spot instances with minimal (often zero) configuration changes.

See [https://github.com/autospotting/autospotting](https://github.com/autospotting/autospotting) for details.

### Sources

The autospotting module can be used from the Terraform Registry or directly from this repository.

You can use the module with prebuilt binaries from the Terraform Registry:

```hcl
module "autospotting" {
  source  = "cristim/autospotting/aws"
  version = "0.0.9" # this version is subject to change
}
```

You can also use the module from this repository, but you'll also need to provide a reference to the autospotting binaries:

```hcl
module "autospotting" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting?ref=master"

  lambda_zipname = "autospotting.zip"
}
```

### Setting variables

Available variables are defined in the [variables file](variables.tf). To change the defaults, just pass in the relevant variables:

```hcl
module "autospotting" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting"

  autospotting_regions_enabled          = "eu*,us*"
  autospotting_min_on_demand_percentage = "33.3"

  lambda_zipname     = "autospotting.zip"
  lambda_memory_size = 1024
}
```

Or you can pass them in on the command line:

``` shell
 terraform apply \
   -var autospotting_regions_enabled="eu*,us*" \
   -var autospotting_min_on_demand_percentage="33.3" \
   -var lambda_zipname="autospotting.zip" \
   -var lambda_memory_size=1024
```

### Using custom binaries

The `autospotting.zip` file can be generated by building it locally. Further instructions are available in the [AutoSpotting repo](https://github.com/autospotting/autospotting).

You can also download the latest official nightly build available [here](https://cloudprowess.s3.amazonaws.com/nightly/autospotting.zip).

#### From local file

If you store the file locally:

```hcl
module "autospotting" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting"

  lambda_zipname = "autospotting.zip"
}
```

#### From S3

Instead of using a local ZIP file you can refer to the Lambda code in a location in S3:

```hcl
module "autospotting" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting"

  lambda_s3_bucket = "lambda-releases"
  lambda_s3_key    = "autospotting.zip"
}
```

### Multiple instances

You can change the names of the resources terraform will create – or run multiple instances of autospotting that target different ASGs – by using the label variables:

```hcl
module "autospotting_storage" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting"

  label_name = "autospotting_storage"

  autospotting_allowed_instance_types = "i3.*"
  autospotting_tag_filters            = "spot-enabled=true,storage-optimized=true,"

  lambda_zipname = "autospotting.zip"
}

module "autospotting_dev_memory" {
  source = "github.com/autospotting/terraform-aws-autospotting"

  label_name        = "autospotting_memory"
  label_environment = "dev"

  autospotting_allowed_instance_types = "r5*"
  autospotting_tag_filters            = "spot-enabled=true,memory-optimized=true,environment=dev,"

  lambda_zipname = "autospotting.zip"
}
```
